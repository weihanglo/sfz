sfz, or **S**tatic **F**ile **Z**erver, is a simple command-line tool serving static files for you.

The name **sfz** is derived from an accented note [Sforzando][sforzando] in music, which means “suddenly with force.”

## Installation

### Automatic

#### macOS

If you are a **macOS Homebrew** user, you can install sfz from a custom tap:

```shell
brew tap weihanglo/sfz https://github.com/weihanglo/sfz.git
brew install sfz
```

> Disclaimer: Formula on **Linuxbrew** did not fully tested.

#### Cargo

If you are a **Rust programmer**, sfz are available on [crates.io][crates.io] via [Cargo][cargo].

```shell
cargo install sfz
```

You can also install the latest version (or a specific commit) of sfz directly from GitHub.

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/weihanglo/sfz.git
```

[crates.io]: https://crates.io
[cargo]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/

### Manual

#### Prebuilt binaries

Archives of prebuilt binaries are available on [GitHub Release][gh-release] for Linux, maxOS and Windows. Download a compatible binary for your system. For convenience, make sure you place sfz under $PATH if you want access it from the command line.

[gh-release]: https://github.com/weihanglo/sfz/releases

#### Build from source

sfz is written in Rust. You need to [install Rust][install-rust] in order to compile it.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/weihanglo/sfz.git
$ cd sfz
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/sfz --version
0.7.1
```

[install-rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html

## Usage

The simplest way to start serving files is to run this command:

```shell
sfz [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [path]
```

The command above will start serving your current working directory on `127.0.0.1:5000` by default.

If you want to serve another directory, pass `[path]` positional argument in with either absolute or relaitve path.

```shell
sfz /usr/local

# Serve files under `/usr/local` directory.
# 
# You can press ctrl-c to exit immediately.
```
